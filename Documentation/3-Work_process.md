# Work process

## Methodology

The methodology that the development team will use is SCRUM. The Daily SCRUM is done everyday, except sunday, in a session of fifteen minutes between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. (depending on the team's disponibility). The sprints have a duration of two weeks, and all the tasks are divided in equal parts between all teh team.

You can check in any moment the advancements of the team by checking our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/OymW6aPy).

The Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective are done the saturdays or sundays once the sprint is finished.

## Team roles

- **Scrum Master:** Joshua Meza
- **Product Owner:** Joshua Meza and Jonathan Gómez
- **Development team:** Joshua Meza, Luis Ortega, Jonathan Gómez y Fabrizio Luna.

## Tools

- GitHub
- Git
- Trello
- WhatsApp
- Discord
- Apiary

## Communication

Due to the current situation, digital media will be the main and only form of communication between the team, Discord will be used as a means of contact by call or to review the progress of the project in conjunction with its live sharing function, however, WhatsApp will be the main tool, because it facilitates immediate and simple communication between all members. A group conversation was created where the whole team is, all the topics to be discussed, the tasks, the changes and everything related or not to the project that requires effective communication.

## Planning

As the main and most essential element, this section defines the requirements of the software to be developed, in this case there are even system requirements since the development is based on an API that will seek to be implemented on an already established platform. It will be planned, with the help of Trello and the schedule of activities, what is expected to be achieved at the end of each version of the project, the necessary documentation in this regard, the relevant tests, the changes that are implemented thanks to failures, improvements or changes in the requirements.

In the same way, weekly group calls are made to discuss the next goals to be achieved, the objectives are divided and certain periods of time are proposed to deliver progress.

With the help of Trello, the team will organize the tasks to be carried out, the board will have the following sections (subject to change or modification):

- To Do: Basically it will be the list of pending tasks to be done, it will have information that specifies things such as who will be in charge of doing it, the estimated time it will take to complete it and the requirement that it seeks to cover. (in case that is the goal of the task).

- Doing: The tasks that are in the development process, must include the start and end date, during this phase it is common that doubts arise that the team must address to finalize them.

- Needs review: Those tasks that have been completed but may not be well implemented, may be poorly optimized, may have particular flaws, or simply need feedback.

- Done: List of tasks completed, tested and considered completed by the team.

## Monitoring

Each member notifies the others of their performance, moves their box to "Needs review" or, failing that, to "Done" in Trello, where they write the progress made up to that point, a brief description of what they did, the problems what they had, what requirement does it meet and if you think you need a meeting to discuss it.

After each prototype released, tests are carried out and documented in the code.

It is essential that the entire team analyze the progress of the others in search of errors, flaws or optimizations that can be made, in order to maintain a good quality standard.

## Metric

The metric is based on *Planning pocker* in where all the team agreed with the amount of participation points that every task will give, based on history points and fibonacci numbers:
