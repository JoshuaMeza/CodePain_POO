# Work process

## Methodology

The methodology that the development team will use is SCRUM. The Daily SCRUM is done everyday, except sunday, in a session of fifteen minutes between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. (depending on the team's disponibility). The sprints have a duration of two weeks, and all the tasks are divided in equal parts between all teh team.

You can check in any moment the advancements of the team by checking our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/OymW6aPy).

The Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective are done the saturdays or sundays once the sprint is finished.
