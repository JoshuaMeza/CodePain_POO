If any user reaches the maximum amount of warnings, default is five, it will be banned from the discord server. This bot will have a personal configuration for the servers owners. 
- In the Domain, the community can make suggestions and follow up other ones, in there, they can see the top ten suggestions of the month, at the end of every month will be a three days period of review, when the administrators or an engine will decide which words that are in the top three could be added into the api, then the request period will start again with the rest of the unselected top ten words preserving the twenty percent of the previous amount of follows, letting people following the same or new options again.
