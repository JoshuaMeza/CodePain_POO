## Description
Rude API is a community tool built for the community and managed by the community where everyone can help improve it. It has a bot on Discord that is actually linked to the API. You as a user can add the specialized bot to a discord channel and manage a personal catalog of forbidden words, including global ones, to have a clean chat. You can help improve and maintain the API by making requests (existing Discord bot command) to include new words in the _offensive word_ list.

## Objective

### General objective

- Launch a free, high-quality tool to help individuals and businesses protect their chats by censoring inappropriate and offensive words. This tool will be created and managed by the community, as it is responsible for making requests to suggest the addition of new words to the API at the end of each month. 
- The primary link between the API and casual users who want an easy and comprehensive protection experience is the Discord bot, which checks Discord messages and determines if there are any "offensive words", finding one will delete the message and will send a DM to the owner as a warning. If any user reaches the maximum number of warnings, five by default, they will be banned from the Discord server. 

### Product Objective

Help people and industries with a **free** tool to create secure filters on your chats. 

## Users

There are some people who would love this project, for example, **communities of discord**, **streamers**, **software engineers**, **companies**, **video game developers** (for if they need filters in the chat), **school chats in discord**, etc. To make this section more understandable, there will be two general user groups: Discord users and developers. 

### Discord users

The most complete experience we can provide to our users is using the Discord bot. This bot is meant to help you protect a channel of discord from _offensive words_ without much work. It is customizable and has a variety of modes that you can test by running simple commands.

This type of administration is perfect for strict or not strict discord communities, for example, communities of streamers, school chats, groups of friends, work servers, etc.

### Developers

If you are part of that group of people who know the APIs and want to create a system that needs an extensive database of _offensive words_ that is continually growing and updated to create a magical system, this is your lucky day! Our API is completely open to you, you can access it at any time by following the documentation.
