## Description

Rude API is a community tool made for the community and managed by the community where all people can help to improve it. It has a bot on Discord that is actually linked to the API. You as user can add the specialized bot to a discord channel and manage a personal cataloge of banned words, including the  general ones, to have a clean chat and you can help improving and maintaining the API by accesing to  the Rude Management page and making requests and voting to increase or reduce the list of *offensive words*.

## Objective

### General objective

- Release a high quality and free tool to help people and enterprises to protect their chats by censoring inappropriate and offensive words. This tool will be made for the community and managed by the community because they are responsible for making requests and pushing other ones to suggest the addition of new words into the API at the end of every month.
- The principal link between the API and casual users that want to enjoy an easy to use and a full experience of protection will be a Discord bot, who checks Discord messages and determine if there is any “offensive word”, if found one, depending of the user settings, it will delete that message and send a dm to the owner as a warning up to five times, or only will delete the message. If any user reaches the maximum amount of warnings, default is five, it will be banned from the discord server. This bot will have a personal configuration for the servers owners. 
- In the Domain, the community can make suggestions and follow up other ones, in there, they can see the top ten suggestions of the month, at the end of every month will be a three days period of review, when the administrators or an engine will decide which words that are in the top three could be added into the api, then the request period will start again with the rest of the unselected top ten words preserving the twenty percent of the previous amount of follows, letting people following the same or new options again.
   

### Product Objective

Help people and industries with a **free** tool to make confident filters in their chats. 

## Users

There are some people that would love this project, in example **discord comunities**, **streamers**, **software engineers**, **enterprises**, **videogame developers** (in case they need to control chats), **school discord chats**, etc. To make more understandable this section, there will be two general groups of users: discord users and developers. 

### Discord users

The most complete experience that we can bring to our users is the usage of the Discord bot. This bot has the objective of help you protecting a discord chanel of *offensive words* without a lot of work. It is customizable and has a variety of modes that you can try by executing simple commands, in example you can change how much warnings a user needs to be banned of thr channel or just select to only censor the *offensive words* and don't make any penalization to your community or group of friends!

This kind of administration is perfect for non strict discord communities, streamers, school discord groups, group of friends, groups of work, etc.

### Developers

If you are one of that group of people that has knowledge about API's and you want to create a system that needs an extensive database of *offensive words* that is continuily growing and getting updated to create a magical system, it is your lucky day! Our API is completely open for you, you can access any time to it by following the documentation.
