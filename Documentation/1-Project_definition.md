## Description

Rude API is a community tool made for the community and managed by the community where all people can help to improve it. It has a bot on Discord that is actually linked to the API. You as a user can add the specialized bot to a discord channel and manage a personal cataloge of banned words, including the global ones, to have a clean chat and you can help improving and maintaining the API by making requests (existing command of the Discord bot) to include new words to the list of _offensive words_.

## Objective

### General objective

- Release a high quality and free tool to help people and enterprises to protect their chats by censoring inappropriate and offensive words. This tool will be made for the community and managed by the community because they are responsible for making requests to suggest the addition of new words into the API at the end of every month.
- The principal link between the API and casual users that want to enjoy an easy and complete experience of protection is the Discord bot, which checks Discord messages and determine if there is any “offensive word”, then, if found one it will delete the message and will send a dm to the owner as a warning. If any user reaches the maximum amount of warnings, five as default, it will get banned from the discord server.

### Product Objective

Help people and industries with a **free** tool to make confident filters in their chats.

## Users

There are some people that would love this project, in example **discord communities**, **streamers**, **software engineers**, **enterprises**, **videogame developers** (in case they need to control chats), **school discord chats**, etc. To make more understandable this section, there will be two general groups of users: discord users and developers.

### Discord users

The most complete experience that we can bring to our users is the usage of the Discord bot. This bot has the objective of help you protecting a discord channel of _offensive words_ without a lot of work. It is customizable and has a variety of modes that you can try by executing simple commands.

This kind of administration is perfect for strict or nonstrict discord communities, for example, streamers communities, school chats, friends groups, work servers, etc.
