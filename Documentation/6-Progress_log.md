| Task                | Start date | End date | Time spent | Comments                            |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Repository creation | 7 Nov      | 12 Nov   | 5 days     | It could have changes in the future |
| Requirements Definition |9 Nov | 12 Nov | 4 days |At the beginning we had planned to include more, time and technical difficulties prevented us, we decided to prioritize and segment them according to the corresponding section|
| Work definition | 9 Nov | 13 Nov | 5 days | It is always difficult to document, we find technical and knowledge barriers that after investigating them could be resolved and discussed to find out the time it could take and the difficulty of the same|
| DataBase development and Update | 11 Nov |  24 Nov | 14 days |  We had to learn to manage a database and organize it in such a way that it is efficient for us to store the words in it, it was delayed due to lack of knowledge and different ideas|
|API development and Update | 1 Jan | 14 Jan | 15 days | At the beginning a version was made but it was not safe, efficient or easy to use, then we ended up developing it object-oriented and with a documentation of both code and use to make it easier to use, we also protected the credentials for any intentional evil that happen|
| Bot development  | 2 Dec | 13 Jan | 12 days | We had to document ourselves in a technical way to develop it in Python, again, at first we thought of a linear code, however we decided to modularize it and orient it to objects to give it greater maintainability and efficiency, we did constant tests on different servers and we got closer to what will be the final version|
| Repository Update | 13 Jan | 15 Jan | 3 days |We created a new branch to keep the deliveries separate to be able to go back, if necessary, to a more primitive version, we uploaded the codes together with their respective documentation, we updated the requirements and documentation in certain sections, there were several changes compared to the first delivery |
| API final update | 15 Jan      | 25 Jan   | 10 days     | The api was put on the host, functionalities and documentation were tested and implemented, there was a time when it crashed but we managed to get it working again |
| BOT final update | 15 Jan      | 8 Feb   | 24 days     | All the functionalities were coded, tested, put online and tested, there were times when there were many bugs, fortunately we managed to find the causes of the problems and we were able to implement a solution to them, the final product is better than expected |
| Database final update | 1 Feb | 3 Feb | 4 days | Tables were created for different functionalities of the bot and the api, at first we had problems when we wanted to link it with the bot, but the results were better than expected, the search, requests and others are efficient |
| Project presentation video | 8 Feb | 8 Feb | 1 day | The bot presented last minute problems that complicated the recording of its functionalities, fortunately we found what caused them and everything works perfectly |
| Final repository update | 1 Feb | 8 Feb | 9 days | The documentation was completed or modified based on what was done during this delivery, the diagrams and user manuals were updated, it was heavy but everything went well, it was complicated by the little activity of the team, but it was possible to get ahead |
