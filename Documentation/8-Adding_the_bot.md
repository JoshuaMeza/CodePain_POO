## Adding it into your server

It's really simple, just [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=784153361058103306&permissions=2081418487&scope=bot) and select the server which you want to protect.

## Actions once joined

When the bot joins into your server, it creates a Category called "RUDEBOT MANAGEMENT" and a Text channel called "rude-admin", in where no one except users with "Rudebot Manager" role can send messages on it.

## Manual settings for working

Once the bot can only watch channels in which it has permissions, you have to give manually the "Rudebot Manager" role to the bot for their correct functionability.

Another thing to keep in mind, is that if you has any channel that you want to protect and it is private, you need to add the "Rudebot Manager" role to the channel to bring the bot the possibility of accessing to it.

## Rude Admin channel

Here is the unique place where the Rudebot Manager's can use the commands of the bot! But, all bot's accesible channels are protected by them.
