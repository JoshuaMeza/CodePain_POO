## Adding it into your server

It's really simple, just [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=784153361058103306&permissions=2081418487&scope=bot) and select the server which you want to protect.

## Actions once joined

When the bot joins into your server, it creates a Category called "RUDEBOT MANAGEMENT" and a Text channel called "rude-admin", in where no one except users with "Rudebot Manager" role can send messages and use commands on it.
